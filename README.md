## SEIR modeling project

In   this   paper   we   expand   classic   SEIRmodel   for   COVID-19   to   include   demographics,   morespecifically  heterogeneous  mix  of  age  groups.  In  the  mostbasic  SEIR-based  model,  the  disease  transmission  rate,recovering   rate   and   death   rate   are   considered   to   behomogeneous   across   the   age   groups.   However,   such   abasic  model  fails  to  give  us  deeper  insight  to  the  diseasetransmission,  for  people  from  different  age  groups  mayshow  significantly  different  infection  and  recovery  trendsover  time.  Simulating  SEIR  for  different  age  groups  isdifficult  because  first,  different  social  interactions  withinthe age group and between the age groups can both affecthow  fast  the  virus  is  spread  for  an  age  group.  Secondly,certain age groups are more likely to contract the virus orhave a harder time to recover from the infection because ofweaker body immune system. Lastly, government quaran-tine policies can often impact age groups differently, whichcould  dramatically  change  transmission  rate  for  a  periodof  time.  With  these  concerns  in  mind,  we  are  bringingin sets of parameters expanding on age groups instead ofusing one fixed rate for transition between stages. Our finalmodel  is  promising  compared  to  the  basic  SEIR  model
